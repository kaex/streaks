# App Icon Creation

For the Streaks app, create a simple app icon that visually represents the concept of habit tracking with streaks. Here's a simple design guideline:

1. Create a 1024x1024 pixel image.
2. Use a dark background (such as #121212 to #2A2A2A gradient).
3. Include a central icon that represents streaks or habits (like a flame icon).
4. Include visual elements that represent a streak (like small circles in a row with some filled and some empty).

You can use any image editing software like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma, or even Canva to create this icon.

Once created, save it as "app_icon.png" in this directory, then run the following command to generate the app icons for Android and iOS:

```
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

This will update your app icons based on the configuration in pubspec.yaml.
